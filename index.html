            <h2>Our Journey Together</h2>
            <p>I love how you’re smart, fierce, and independent, but still so wonderfully soft and loving. The way you give me those big, warm hugs that make everything feel right in the world, the way you speak with such elegance and grace in English, and even how you can’t resist doing a little happy dance when food’s on the table — it's all part of what makes you so special to me.<p>
                
            </p>

                You’re sexy, hot, and so irresistible, but what I love most is your heart. You are as lovable as you are strong, and every moment I spend with you reminds me how lucky I am. Your clinginess only makes me feel even more adored, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I love the way you care for me, and how, no matter the situation, you always manage to make everything feel better.</p>

            <p>Thank you for making these past 11 months unforgettable. Here's to many more months and years of laughter, hugs, dancing, and love. I love you more than words can say.
